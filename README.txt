Welcome to "Find out your country's neighbours" application !!!

This is a cool little pet project that I developed just to find out if the 'navigator' 
can get a user's location and to show some details of a country as well as its neighbours.

I used HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript ES6 to build this cool little single page app.

There are 3 main functionalities that a user can take advantage of.

The first one makes use of the input in the app. You just type in the name of a country and it 
will send a request to a public API and it gets all the relevant details of the required country.

The second one will get the country from your browser without the user needing to type 
in the desired country and it will return the same type of result as the first functionality.

The third functionality will choose a random country allowing the user to just explore or to just
choose at random the country for the next vacation.

Check out the custom favicon ðŸ˜‰

Hope you enjoy !!!
